# swift-xcode

![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active--development-blue.svg)

Xcode workspace and shared-scheme serialization with atomic file generation, without importing Foundation.

---

## Quick Start

```swift
import Xcode_Workspace

let workspace = Xcode.Workspace(references: [
    .init(location: .group("Application")),
    .init(location: .group("Packages/swift-json"))
])

try workspace.write(to: "/path/to/institute.xcworkspace")
```

Serialization flows through the Layer-3 [swift-xml](https://github.com/swift-foundations/swift-xml) package; application consumers do not serialize W3C XML directly.

---

## Installation

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-foundations/swift-xcode.git", branch: "main")
]
```

Add a product to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Xcode Workspace", package: "swift-xcode")
    ]
)
```

Products:

- `Xcode Workspace` exposes `Xcode.Workspace` serialization and atomic writes.
- `Xcode Scheme` exposes `Xcode.Scheme` serialization and atomic writes.

### Requirements

- Swift 6.3+
- macOS 26+
